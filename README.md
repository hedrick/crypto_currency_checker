# Crypto Currency Update
## Pet-Project program written in Go that displays current info on certain crypto currencies.

### Going Forward
1. Print all coins from coincap.io in a neat, easy to read format
2. Print specific coins as argument by symbol
3. Print all coins that are up in the last 24hrs
4. Print all coins that are down in the last 24hrs

## This is really just a pet project to learn Go ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
